CorpStock.LI=<li>{CorpStock.sec}</li>

Note=The CorpStock.LI allows adding more than one section in that position in the outline. This is needed for the NonStock company outline. Here we include a default roll-over from "LI" to "sec", but in the NonStock the "LI" is overridden with two sections.   XXX.li at the bottom of the list of sections allows adding to the list of sections.  The format would be XXX.LI=&lt;li&gt;Content of the section&lt;/li&gt;  This is normally zero-ed out by the following default, which is XXX.LI=&lt;/i&gt;.  HTML renders this as blank, nulling out the {XXX.LI}.  Override it in your form or document if you wish. See an example in the /DE/NonStock/CertificateOfIncorporation/0.md
